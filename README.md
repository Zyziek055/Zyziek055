```
Economics student, specializing in Computer Science and Econometrics.
Interested in Data Science and generally anything computer related :)

I run a home server on my Raspberry Pi 5 (with an NVMe from my old laptop for extra storage) and Ubuntu OS on my main PC.

In my free time, I usually break something on my Pi and then spend the rest of the day fixing it :D
